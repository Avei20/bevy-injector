# Bevy Injector

Injector Bevy via API 

## Ideas 
Basically this is an upgraded version from https://github.com/digaji/csv-to-bevy by [Jason Jeremy](https://github.com/digaji).
Jason is using Selenium to accessing Bevy Dashboard and Inject the attendees. This repository more raw and fast by using direch hit to Bevy API. For warning, this may be illegal to do and ban the account from gdg.community.dev

## How to Use It ? 
1. Install the package used for this script
```python
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
if using MacOS, better to create virtual environment using venv or pyenv 

```angular2html
cont later. I'm lazy to write well write and reusable code. 
```
